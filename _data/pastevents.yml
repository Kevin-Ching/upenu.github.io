  name: Jane Street Tech Talk
  date: September 21, 2018
  desc: Electronic exchanges play an important role in the world financial system, acting as focal points where actors from across the world meet to trade with each other. But building an exchange is a difficult technical challenge, requiring high transaction rates, low, deterministic response times, fairness, and reliability. This talk looks at the question of how to design an exchange through the lens of JX, a crossing engine we built at Jane Street in the last two years. Performance plays an interesting role in this design, in that, although the end-to-end latency of the system is not important in and of itself, the ability of individual components of JX to handle messages rates in the 500k/sec range with latencies in the single-digit microseconds helped us build a replicated system that is both simple and robust.

  name: UPE Presents Machine Learning
  date: April 2, 2018
  desc: The rise of Deep Learning (DL) has marked the most fruitful era of AI research to date. Today, startups and larger companies are rapidly deploying DL-enabled technologies into products. However, to effectively deploy DL at scale, you need a "full stack" DL engineering team that covers a wide range of skills. In this talk, I begin by I inclusively defining the full stack of skills and technologies that go into DL engineering. Second, for the future entrepreneurs in the room, I provide some advice on how to build, coach, and grow a full-stack DL engineering team. Third, I provide advice on how a generalist or specialist engineer can engage with a full-stack DL engineering team, and I describe a path for how to ultimately become a full-stack DL engineer. As a bonus, I share some lessons and experiences that I have picked up on my journey from completing a PhD in EECS at UC Berkeley to founding and growing our company, DeepScale.
