      <p>
        Upsilon Pi Epsilon is the first and only international honor society for the computing and information disciplines and is endorsed by ACM and IEEE. UPE aims to recognize academic excellence and promote academic and professional growth of its members. The UC Berkeley chapter, launched in 1995, honors the top tier of Computer Science students on campus. 

      </p>
      <p>
        Each semester, we extend membership to the top third of declared CS majors as provided by the CS department. Candidates will join one of our committees and contribute to the Berkeley CS community. Initiates are UPE members for life.
