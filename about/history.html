        Upsilon Pi Epsilon is the first and only international honor society for the computing and information
        disciplines and is endorsed by ACM and IEEE. UPE aims to recognize academic excellence and promote
        academic and professional growth of its members. The UC Berkeley chapter, launched in 1995, honors the
        top tier of Computer Science students on campus. Our organization has been recognized as an "Outstanding
        Chapter" by the UPE National Council. For more information about the national chapter, visit
        <a href="http://upe.acm.org/">here</a>.

        Each semester, we extend membership to the top third of declared CS majors as provided by the CS
        department. Candidates will join one of our committees and contribute to the Berkeley CS community.
        Initiates are UPE members for life.
