    <p><b>ðŸ˜· PLEASE NOTE: Due to the COVID-19 situation, office hours have been moved online. Please click the hangouts link on the calendar invite when you wish to attend your office hours. Phone Interviews, Peer Advising, and Resume Critiques will still be conducted.</b></p>
    <p>Navigating your career as a CS student can be tough, but having a friend who's been through it all can help tremendously. UPE offers all of the following as free services to the Berkeley student community.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    {% include section-header.html title="Resume Reviews" %}
    <p>Each resume critique <b> lasts 30 minutes at the UPE Office at 346 Soda Hall</b>. Resume Critiques are hosted by one of our Professional Development committee members. We prefer a printed copy but are willing to accommodate electronic copies if provided. </p>

  <div class="section">
    {% include section-header.html title="Mock Interviews" %}
    <p>We offer mock technical interviews in two formats: whiteboard interviews and phone interviews.
    Whiteboard interviews <b>last one hour at the UPE Office at 346 Soda Hall.</b>
    Phone interviews <b>last one hour and are conducted remotely.</b></p>
    <p>When you sign up for a phone interview, you will receive a Google Hangouts link, Zoom link, or a phone number through a confirmation email.
    After this, the interviewer will send over a code-collab link or Google Doc link for codesharing during the interview.</p>
    <p>The breakdown for the interview time will be as follows:
    <ol>
      <li> The first ten minutes will be a berkeley-time buffer. </li>
      <li> The first five minutes will be an overview of your academic and professional background so our interviewer can find a problem taylored to your liking </li>
      <li> The next five minutes will be focused on talking about your experience. It will be a typical "tell me about yourself" question. </li>
      <li> The next thirty-five minutes you will be solving a technical interview question </li>
      <li> The last five minutes will be dedicated to questions and interview feedback for the interviewee. </li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    {% include section-header.html title="Career Mentorship" %}
    <p>Members of UPE tend to have an abundance of experiences in teaching, research, internships, and academics. Our peer advising appointments are a great way for students outside of UPE, from freshman to seniors, to learn more about how to navigate their own paths through the Berkeley computer science community and beyond.</p>
